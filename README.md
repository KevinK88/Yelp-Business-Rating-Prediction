# Overview 
- The goal of this project was to predict businessâ€™ star ratings based on the given customer business reviews in the Yelp dataset. The reviews were converted to a TF-IDF Matrix which was then given to a neural network.
- Used different structures of neural networks such as activation functions, and optimizers to discover a model that best predicts the star ratings of the businesses.

# Methodology:
- Created a dataframe from the JSON file, review.json, containing all the reviews and their associated business ids.
- Created different neural network models for training.

# Result:
- RMSE for each model
